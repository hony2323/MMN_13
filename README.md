# **MMN_13**


## Using the run.bat file
Assuming you are running the code in windows, just double-click \
the batch file: `run.bat`

## Using the **venv**
using your command line interface, and being\
on the right directory, use: `.\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\src\main.py`

## Errors
if there is and error with the paths of stuff, try putting your project's \
path in the ROOT_DIR in the main directory

#### Manually
I have presented some options to run the project without \
having to come to this extreme but if you like requirements so much then 
* Python recommended version is 3.9.13 or above
* The required libraries are pointed in the requirements.txt file\
  in order to install them, run: \
  `pip install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt` \
  at the moment, it is empty and I believe it would stay like this
* then run it with `python .\src\main.py`
